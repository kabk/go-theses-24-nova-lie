              Shoeprints from the muddy path across the rain-touched, cracked
              pavement. Moss-filled crevices and the weeds reclaiming a
              forgotten corner. The crumbling wall with graffiti and ivy, and
              the efforts to remove them both. Shadows casted by the urban
              structures and the leaves of the tree. Broken windows and a puddle
              reflecting the landscape in a distorted mirrored dimension. This
              essay is a reflective exploration of <b>Graphic Events</b>, the
              visual proof of inevitable change, that is the real life of our
              designed graphics. The story unfolds to reveal signs of the
              twilight-zone where human creations meet nature reasserting its
              presence—returning to its home amid a capitalist-commercial visual
              monoculture. This study hopes to explore and deepen the
              understanding of the visual culture that is created as effects of
              human impact on the ecology of our planet. Through analysing and
              deconstructing the Graphic Event’s perceivable materiality I aim
              to find the sublime in the everyday so-called mundane graphics.<br /><br />

            <h2 id="intro">Introduction to Graphic Events</h2>

            <p>
              Shadows casted by our designs, as the ever-shifting dance of
              clouds and the sun light up the scene. Whether it’s the patterns
              of dust or snow settling on surfaces, the vibrant chaos of a
              changing graffiti-covered brickwall, or the gradual decay of a
              discarded piece of paper—These visual phenomena vividly reflect
              the dynamic life inherent in <b>Graphic Events</b>.<br />
              <br />
              The term was first coined by James Dyer and Nick Deakin in their
              book “Graphic Events: A Realist Account of Graphic Design”<sup
                class="footnote"
                ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup
              >
              published in 2022. Here, they stress the importance on
              distinguishing a design from its lived life, as we often treat a
              graphic as a fixed substance,
              <i>“…denying its life and dismissing it’s vitality</i>.”<sup
                class="footnote"
                ><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup
              >
              Talking with James Williams, they discuss the concept of ‘process
              philosophy’ that prioritises that events are in motion. On the
              importance on keeping things in motion and having an accurate
              representation on how things exist, he answers them, “<i
                >There are two reasons. The first is that by dismissing or
                denying change you are committing a violent act; you are not
                only denying the thing that is changing you are also denying all
                the values and lives around it.</i
              >”<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>
              They refer to Alfred North Whitehead that describes the so-called
              “Event” as “<i>wherever or whenever something is going on.</i
              >”<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>
              This means that everything from a moving atom at a metaphysical
              level, to a seemingly static light pole in the city is in a
              constant state of flux as they constantly interact with their
              environment as a dynamic entity, enduring its existence.
              <br /><br />Graphic Events as a concept, encapsulates a diverse
              array of visuals, making it challenging to pin where one ends and
              another begins. The term embraces subjectivity, acknowledging that
              Graphic Events are inherently subjective and can only be fully
              perceived through the eyes of an observer at a specific moment in
              time. This inherent subjectivity underscores the uniqueness of
              each event, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of this
              concept and why I find it important to document them.<br />
              <br />
              At every moment in time there is change happening, whether a
              mountain erosion or the sun moving across the sky. Our designed
              materials undergo constant change, developing a life on their own.
              <i
                >“This is how it is with objects. They are mostly mute about
                their journeys, though most of them have traveled much farther
                than any of us.</i
              >»<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>
              External forces and internal mechanisms inevitably lead to decay,
              guiding the matter through its life cycle. Graphic Events serve as
              a visual testament to the resilience of nature, showcasing the
              universal truth that all entities adhere to the same cosmic laws.
              This worldview opens an endless stream of unique motifs as the
              events manifests as nature’s visual response to our designs and
              inventions. They are the proof, or rather the silent witnesses
              observing the constant motion of the currently anthropocentric
              world.
              <br /><br />
              Despite domination of our surroundings though altered cityscapes
              and human attempts to control and shape the environment as some
              sort of masters of the cosmos, the shapes of Nature are present.
              Either in powerful ways such as extreme weather, natural hazards,
              pandemics, and warzones. Even human-made environmental impacts
              like deforestation and contaminated soil as results of
              industrialization and climate change. Or in subtle ways,
              camouflaged as the weathered, the unkempt, and the signs of the
              past such as fingerprints, graffiti, and scratches, as well as
              Nature’s designs of a pile of leaves on the pavement. Everything
              is undergoing its own cycle of life and death to pave the way for
              new beginnings. This fundamental truth, rooted in the natural
              order, persists in the face of human inventions and interventions.
              This essay advocates for a design philosophy that collaborates and
              harmonizes with these events, rejecting thoughtlessness and
              disrespect on the importance of what these happenings can tell us
              about ourselves and our surroundings. Ultimately revealing the
              face of the unregulated visual testimony that is our non-designed
              visual culture.
              <br /><br />

              we can mass-produce items with perfectly smooth and consistent
              surfaces. Vectorized and photoshopped visuals are dominant in both
              our physical surroundings but also in our hyper engineered digital
              landscape. A standardized visual language has taken over both the
              web and the world. As we start to speak the same vocal language,
              we also begin to speak the same visual language. The sans-serif
              flat logo trend is popular because it prioritizes functionality
              and accessibility, the result is an aesthetic monoculture.<sup

            <p>
              Graphic Events can possess a sublime aesthetic beauty that is
              worth taking notice of. Whether for creative expression or
              philosophic reflection–the cyclical weathered phenomena can serve
              as inspiration for its protesting and persistent qualities. In
              this chapter I will explore our shared, non-designed visual
              culture and the materiality of what they can look like through
              four patterns already found in nature:
              <b>Meander, Packing, Cracks and Explosion</b>. I am using these
              brackets not as strict separations but rather as organizational
              tools to comprehend and discuss their visual characteristics and
              their perceivable materiality. While mathematics may explain their
              creation, this essay takes a different path, as I am exploring
              them through a typology of my own eyes. As human survival is
              deeply rooted in recognizing patterns to anticipate and understand
              our surroundings, I believe that designers and creatives should
              gain a better vocabulary when talking about the dynamic interplay
              or forces and the inherent irregularity of organic processes
              inherent in Graphic Events. I hope this analysis together with the
              deconstruction of the events can help to overcome some of the
              stigma surrounding their presence and highlight the romantic
              opportunistic life of Graphic Events. With this effort of
              acknowledging their characteristics I aim to make encountering
              them more accessible to the average person to appreciate their
              aesthetic qualities.

              In George Simmel's “Die Ruine” (1911) A crumbing ruin from what
              was once a human-made structure can be seen as nature transforming
              the materials she once served for artwork, into materials for her
              own artistic expression.<sup class="footnote"

            <blockquote>
              “The balance between nature and spirit which the building
              manifested shifts in favour of nature. The shift becomes a cosmic
              tragedy. Which so we feel, makes every ruin infused with our
              nostalgia.: for now the decay appears as natures revenge. For the
              spirit's having violated it by making a form in it's own
              image.”<sup class="footnote"

              <b> Types of weathering:</b>
              <br /><br />
              According to David Suzuki there are three types of decay:<br />
              Mechanical—An outer factor or impact <br />Chemical—The chemical
              structure is altered. Because it is a universal solvent, water is
              an effective agent in the weathering ad decomposing rocks.
              <br />Biological—A natural process within the object.<br /><br />
              Only two hundred years ago, it was though that mountains, lakes
              and deserts were permanent and unchanging. Now we know that the
              surface of the globe has been undergoing constant change since its
              beginning—and that it still is; even mountains can wear down over
              time though weathering. The smooth impeccable surface will be
              roughened; wear and tear will heave and crack the concrete, water
              draining from driveways beyond will erode channels. Imagine people
              feet wearing away the surface particle by particle, dust-laden
              winds scouring the surface, winter rain infiltrating a thousand
              tiny pores and expanding as it freezes. <br />Water dissolving,
              the sun staining or altering the ink. Corroding substances. <br />
              <br />
              Endo decay— When decomposition comes from the inside <br />Exo
              decay— Where the decomposition is caused by an external
              environmental force. <br />
              The two processes are often entangled and hardly ever neat. <br />
              <br />
              Geotrauma Condensation and the hydrologic cycle. In many ways you
              can look at everything as a transportation of water. <br />
              The whole enterprise of life as just a vehicle for the
              transformation of water. Because it is a universal solvent, water
              is an effective agent in the weathering ad decomposing rocks. -

              The nature on the other end is not fighting but rather responding
              in a quiet, persistent visual language.

              My dad was the one who first pointed out and introduced me to
              recognizing and appreciating the beauty of unplanned visual
              compositions. He has always had an obsession over unique and
              ideosyntactic textures found in the wild. Poster residue, water
              damage, dirt splatter, cracks, scratches, scuffs, graffiti,
              peeling paint, discoloration, rust stains, dents, and chips.
              Whenever he came across something that caught his eye, he would
              swiftly retrieve his camera from his belt bag. My recent study of
              the Flâneur, has led me to realize that he embodies this concept
              himself as a connoisseur of the streets. The term first came about
              in 19th-century Paris. Then referring to a man in the city
              wandering and observing, without being observed. My dad’s tendency
              to walk ten meters behind my mother and me, always on the lookout
              for an image, drifting off, disappearing into the visuals of the
              landscape—confirms my theory. I always appreciated his willingness
              to take his time to show me these compositions, non the less even
              taking the time to move closer to them to observe the details. But
              as I looked around me I was surprised not to find more people
              stopping to pay close attention to matters like him. <br /><br />
