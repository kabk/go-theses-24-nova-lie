            <p>
              This essay delves into the concept of <em>Visual Events</em>.
              Seemingly insignificant details like muddy shoeprints on the
              pavement, moss-filled crevices and weeds reclaiming a forgotten
              corner, a crumbling wall with graffiti and ivy, and the efforts to
              remove them both. Shadows casted by urban structures and the
              leaves of the tree. Broken windows and a puddle reflecting the
              landscape in a distorted mirrored dimension—The visual proof of
              change, that is the real life of our designed objects. This
              exploration unfolds in the twilight zone where human creations
              meet nature's determined regeneration, highlighting the tension
              between the capitalist-commercial aesthetic and the organic forces
              that persist. Through analysing and deconstructing the Visual
              Event’s perceivable appearance, this essay aims to find the
              sublime in the unnoticed visual details. With this perspective,
              advocating for a design philosophy that actively collaborates with
              the events, embracing their transformative nature and recognizing
              their life force.

            <br />
            <p>
              Inspired by James Dyer and Nick Deakin's concept of
              <em>Graphic Events</em> in their book "<em
                >Graphic Events: A Realist Account of Graphic Design</em
              >" (2022), I propose the broader term—<em>Visual Events.</em> This
              encompasses not only the lived experiences of graphic elements,
              but any visual phenomenon that emerges from the landscape,
              contrasting with intentional human design. These events are not
              flaws, but whispers of time, glimpses into the past, revealed by
              the shapes of puddles clinging to the pavement
              <a href="#imageLink6" class="visual-event-link" id="anchorLink6"
                >(★)</a
              >
              , ivy climbing up a building
              <a href="#imageLink7" class="visual-event-link" id="anchorLink7"
                >(★)</a
              >
              , faded handprints on a sunlit window
              <a href="#imageLink8" class="visual-event-link" id="anchorLink8"
                >(★)</a
              >
              and the scars of stains and scratches on a cracking concrete
              flooring
              <a href="#imageLink9" class="visual-event-link" id="anchorLink9"
                >(★)</a
              >
              . In this essay I will examine the perceivable landscape that
              surrounds us where Visual Events acts as a counterpoint to our
              constructed environment, revealing the unregulated visual culture
              that unfolds around us.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Dyer and Deakin advocate for distinguishing design from its lived
              reality, arguing against treating graphics as static, they
              challenge the dismissal of "<em>its vitality</em>" and advocate
              for a <em>process philosophy</em> that acknowledges the constant
              motion of things. James Williams, in conversation with them,
              emphasizes the importance of respecting change:
              <em
                >“There are two reasons. The first is that by dismissing or
                denying change you are committing a violent act; you are not
                only denying the thing that is changing you are also denying all
                the values and lives around it.”</em
              ><a
                href="#fn1"
                class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref1"
                role="doc-noteref"
                ><sup>1</sup></a
              >
              They refer to Alfred North Whitehead who describes the
              <em>Event</em> as
              <em>“wherever or whenever something is going on.”,</em> suggesting
              that everything from a moving atom at a metaphysical level, to a
              seemingly static light pole in the city is in a constant state of
              flux as they constantly interact with their environment as a
              dynamic entity, enduring its existence.<a
                href="#fn2"
                class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref2"

            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Similarly, Jane Bennett’s "<em
                >Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things</em
              >" (2010) empowers the material agency of objects and acknowledges
              their ability to contain power <em>(Thing-power)</em

                ><sup>3</sup></a
              >—their ability to influence and shape the world—And in the sense
              of this essay, the perceivable visual culture of what I define as
              a Visual Event. Bennett cites Bruno Latour on his idea of ‘an
              actant’; “<em
                >…a source of action that can be either human or non-human; it
                is that which has efficacy, can do things, has sufficient
                coherence to make a difference, produce effects, alter the
                course of events.</em
              >”<a
                href="#fn4"
                class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref4"
                role="doc-noteref"
                ><sup>4</sup></a
              >
              The effects of the events can be extensively varied in intensity.
              James Williams calls the diagrams of the different and varying
              effects the
              <em>substratum</em>.<a
                href="#fn5"
                class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref5"
                role="doc-noteref"

              >
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Considering the widely ranging substratum and effects,
              interpretations, meanings, and emotions that may be connected to a
              Visual Event, it can be hard to comprehend the varying faces of
              what they may look like and where one begins and another one ends.
              The term embraces subjectivity, acknowledging that Visual Events
              are inherently subjective and can only be perceived and observed
              through the eyes of an observer at a specific moment in time as
              the event may change rapidly

                >(★)</a
              >
              . This inherent subjectivity underscores the uniqueness of each
              event, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of each event
              and the importance of empirical documentation.

              External forces and internal mechanisms inevitably lead to decay,
              guiding the matter through its life cycle. Visual Events serve as
              a visual testament to the resilience of nature, showcasing the
              universal truth that all entities adhere to the same cosmic laws.
              This perspective unlocks a vast array of unique motifs, where the
              events become nature's visual response to our designs and
              inventions. They serve as silent witnesses to the constant motion
              of our anthropocentric world.<a

              pave the way for new beginnings. This fundamental truth, rooted in
              the natural order, persists in the face of human inventions and
              interventions. This essay advocates for a design philosophy that
              collaborates and harmonizes with these natural events, rejecting
              thoughtlessness and demonstrating respect for the valuable
              insights they provide about us and our environment. Ultimately
              revealing the faces of the unregulated Visual Events that is our
              non-designed visual culture.

              As citizens in the Age of the Mechanical Reproduction we can
              mass-produce items with perfectly smooth and consistent surfaces.

              Vectorized and photoshopped visuals are dominant in both our
              physical surroundings but also in our hyper engineered digital
              landscape. A standardized visual language has taken over both the
              web and the world. As we start to speak the same vocal language,
              we also begin to speak the same visual language. The sans-serif
              flat logo trend is popular because it prioritizes functionality
              and accessibility, the result is an aesthetic monoculture. The
              refreshing presence of
              <strong>Visual Events</strong> becomes a contrast to this notion,
              as something new and unique.

                Urban existence in the twenty-first century reflects the
                underlying values of our industrial consumerist world. The
                human-engineered habitat—an intricate tapestry woven from
                threads of manufactured and curated natural elements, dominate
                our view. The construction of the city and all our efforts to
                control and tidy up nature’s responses

                In Ben Wilsons book, “<em>Urban Jungle”</em> (2021) he reflects
                on the opportunistic lives of nature in the corners of the city.

                he writes. This hierarchical discrimination against plants
                mirrors broader societal biases, drawing on ideas of hostility
                and preconceived notions of what's "unacceptable." The prejudice

                As much as we are drawn to the comfort of a ‘secure space’, we
                are equally drawn to the matters that are beyond our control. In
                some cases, we exhibit a peculiar fascination with elements that
                tell a story in their vulnerability and beauty with its
                ‘imperfections’. This fascination is evident in the
                fetishization of errors and deviations, considering them rare
                and more valuable. For instance, in coins that have production
                errors or designs that deviates from the original. This
                phenomenon extends to other design realms, where mistakes are
                not merely tolerated but even appreciated and valued. Errors,
                misspelling, misprints, and recalled products due to production
                errors become collectors' items. However, these rarities are
                mere exceptions in the vast, uniform aesthetic of our urban
                environments, which often feel all too familiar.

                are not deviations from nature but interwoven elements within
                its complex system. As human creations interact with the Earth's
                elements, they give rise to new forms of alchemy—The fusion of
                human-made and natural elements brings forth entities like
                plastiglomerate, where materials like plastic meld with natural
                elements through the simple act of a beach bonfire, symbolizing

                Visual Events, in their essence, reveal this deep connection by
                displaying the tangible interweaving of human existence with the
                natural world, illustrating how we, alongside our inventions,
                contribute to the formation of a new visual culture. This
                realization challenges the notion that our constructed
                environments can exist as isolated, sterile entities. Instead,
                it underscores how we, and everything we create, serve as living
                canvases for the ongoing narrative of nature. This narrative is
                not just a backdrop but a dynamic, interactive scene that calls
                for an urgent re-engagement with our ecological origins.

          <article>
            <section>
              <p>
                Visual Events can possess a sublime aesthetic beauty that is
                worth taking notice of. The cyclical weathered phenomena can
                serve as inspiration for its protesting and persistent
                qualities. To truly appreciate their visual language, an
                exploration into the transformative processes that bring them to
                life is crucial, which I refer to as "Decay" — a term denoting
                metamorphosis rather than mere deterioration. Decay is the
                patient artist, crafting with the tool of time to reveal hidden
                narratives beneath the surface. Every mark, from the rust of a
                nail (★) to the lichen creeping on a corner (★), becomes a
                brushstroke on nature's ever-evolving canvas. In George Simmel’s
                “The Ruin” (1911) a crumbling ruin from what was once a
                human-made structure can be seen as nature transforming
                materials once used for artwork into materials for her own
                artistic expression (★).
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  <em>
                    “…The balance between nature and spirit, which the building
                    manifested, shifts in favor of nature. This shift becomes a
                    cosmic tragedy which, so we feel, makes every ruin an object
                    infused with our nostalgia; for now the decay appears as
                    nature's revenge for the spirit's having violated it by
                    making a form in its own image… Nature has transformed the
                    work of art into material for her own expression, as she had
                    previously served as material for art. According to its
                    cosmic order, the hierarchy of nature and spirit usually
                    shows nature as the substructure, so to speak, the raw
                    material, or semifinished product; the spirit, as the
                    definitely formative and crowning element. The ruin reverses
                    this order: what was raised by the spirit becomes the object
                    of the same forces which form the contour of the mountain
                    and the bank of the river.”</em

                Nature responds quietly, persistently, in a visual language, not
                fighting but conversing. David Suzuki's taxonomy of decay,
                categorized into Mechanical, Chemical, and Biological, offers a
                lens to understand the various ways in which visual events come
                into being.<a

                    <em>Mechanical decay</em>, arising from external factors or
                    impacts, unfolds in the aftermath of sudden bursts of
                    energy, (★) leaving visible imprints like scratches, (★)
                    graffiti, (★) or footprints (★). These events leave behind
                    instant or gradual trails, like the desire-paths (★) formed
                    by repeated footsteps. The mechanical decay can also be seen
                    as outer mechanism interfering as <em>exo-decay</em

                A Visual Event can embody multiple elements of this taxonomy.
                The interplay between the different forms of decay and
                fundamental pattern in nature creates a complex visual language,
                one that illuminates the sublime beauty found within our urban
                landscapes.

            Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost
          </h3>
          <p>
            Growing up in Norway I learnt about nature from my parents during
            weekly walks in the surrounding forest of Oslo through my childhood.
            My dad’s knowledge about how to survive in nature and my mom’s
            ability to identify various natural phenomena inspires me endlessly.
            My journey into the sublime aesthetic world of Visual Events began
            with my father. During walks in Oslo or somewhere else, he pointed
            out the unique
            <em>images</em> that the city offered him—poster residue, water
            damage, dirt splatter, cracks, scratches, scuffs, graffiti, peeling
            paint, discoloration, rust stains, dents, chips and more (★). He saw
            beauty in these unplanned compositions, meticulously documenting
            them with his camera. While I appreciated his aesthetic, it wasn't
            until recently that I grasped their deeper value. This "lens of
            attention," combined with a compassionate eye for urban phenomena,
            resonates with the concept of the <em>Flâneur</em>, that I believe
            him to be a perfect example of. A Flâneur is one who wanders the
            city with no particular plan or specific end-destination. The term
            first came about in 1870’s, Paris, when strollers and idlers were
            observing the urban experience. A figure of masculine privilege and
            leisure, with time and no immediate responsibilities to claim his
            attention. My father’s wandering and escapist qualities always
            inspired me to pay attention to details and the visual landscape
            surrounding me, and after learning about the feminine version;
            <em>Flâneuse</em>, I followed the footsteps of my father,
            romanticizing walks, and life in the city, as I was stumbling across
            visuals that pops out of the landscape like they were made for only
            me to see.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I always was a romantic at heart, mezmerized by the tapestry of the
            clouds and having empathy to nature and other life forms. But it was
            during the time when I started to play Animal Crossing on my
            Nintendo Switch that I started to truly appreciate the uniqueness of
            everything in the real world contrasting the design in the game of a
            simplified and stylized world (★). Every item I found outside had
            its unique daily or seasonal features, everyday a special edition
            and all the different objects with each their special trait (★).

            However, maneuvering the cityscape as a woman can be a different
            affair than for a man as women have faced more obstacles in
            accessing urban spaces and have therefore not been able to navigate
            the cityscape unnoticed through history. Virginia Woolf in “<em
              >Street Haunting: A London Adventure</em
            >” (1930), writes about the way a woman’s experience was different
            from a man’s was in what level of anonymity one could gain. In
            Woolf’s essay, the protagonist’s anonymity is possible by taking on
            the role of “<em>an enormous eye</em>”<a

            She claims that to focus on being the gaze instead of being gazed
            at, can bring strong empowerment. Personally, this is the method I
            tend to use as well. The flâneuse gets to know the streets by
            walking on foot, she goes where she is not supposed to, and she may
            use the streets as a place to hide or to show off. Letting the
            landscape lure her in, examining something at a closer distance,
            taking time to stop and look.

            Examining Visual Events has been an eye-opening journey, revealing a
            universe of inspiration that expands each day. The concept invites
            us to shift our perspective and engage with the world around us with
            a more curious and appreciative eye. The act of focusing and
            un-focusing, shifting one's perspective, unveils the profound
            importance of individual experience and the subjective lens through
            which we perceive the world. By actively seeking out and documenting
            these ever-evolving phenomena, we can contribute to a broader
            understanding of our relationship with the built environment and the
            natural forces that shape it. We are, in essence, the sole witnesses
            to these transient phenomena, and the act of documentation becomes
            the sole repository of their unique stories. The potential of
            incorporating nature’s inherent unpredictability into design
            intrigues me. I envision future collaborations with individuals from
            diverse fields of knowledge, fostering a deeper understanding of the
            ‘<em>whys’</em> and’<em>hows’</em>
            behind Visual Events. Rather than seeking control and permanence,
            what if we actively embraced the transformative nature of Visual
            Events? What if we recognized the inherent life force within them, a
            force worthy of collaboration rather than suppression? This approach
            would lead to designs that are more adaptable, more resilient, and
            ultimately more beautiful as the layers of time and natural
            processes is embedded within them. It would be a design philosophy
            marked by humility, respect, and a willingness to cede some control
            to the unpredictable forces that shape our world. By embracing the
            sublime in the overlooked, we will create spaces that are not only
            visually mesmerizing but also deeply resonates with the rhythms of
            life, reminding us of our interconnectedness with the natural world
            and our impermanence within its grand design.

                  Anthropocene is a term for the geological period of our times
                  where humans have impacted the ecology of our planet through
                  industrialization, urbanization, and widespread environmental
                  alterations, reshaping the planet's geologic and ecological
                  fabric.

                  According to Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of
                  Mechanical Reproduction", artworks can be mass-produced,
                  disseminated widely, and lose their singular, authentic
                  existence tied to a specific time and place. This shift has
                  significant implications for the way people perceive and
                  experience art, as well as for the role of art in culture and
                  society. (Benjamin 1935)

                    the society and its normative systems within which we move
                    and live. The social order surrounding us is strongly marked
                    by regulatory systems and strategies which are, as Edensor
                    writes, continuously followed to ensure the stability of
                    meaning and purpose (Edensor 2005, 313). Personal and social
                    identity, more often than not, depend on the stability and
                    fixity of this order which is maintained through
                    constructing networks which variously comprise objects,
                    humans, spaces, technologies and forms of knowledge (Law
                    1993). Hence, there is very
                    <u>little room for disorder and error</u>, given that space
                    is meticulously divided into discrete, functional,
                    single-purpose realms (Sibley 1988).”, “The Aesthetics of
